                    Transferring ideas of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-place#:~:text=Non%2Dplace%20or%20nonplace%20is,places%22%20in%20their%20anthropological%20definition."><u>non-place</u></a> and the photography of Lynne Cohen into digital interactions, the space of a waiting
                    room is replicated onto the Internet, the ultimate non-place. Here, users must reckon with various
                    objects while they wait. The objects all have a unique set
                    of interactions built in; some relate to one another while others are completely independent.
                    Interactions are all somewhat incoherent in nature, offering moments of surprise for
                    users, generating a micro-narrative in an otherwise mundane environment. Reinforcing the
                    idea a non-space, a muzak cover of <i>Close to You</i> by the Carpenters loops in the background,
                    offers respite from waiting, but gradually transforms into the
                    soundtrack of purgatory as it endlessly repeats.<br><br>

                    By completing each interaction, users will advance their position in the queue. The order in which these actions
                    occur does not matter, there is no linear path to reach the final event where users can
                    finally leave the current room. However, despite advancing into the next space, the user will
                    always find themselves similar room again, perpetually waiting and preoccupying themselves
                    with interactions in hopes that something meaningful might happen.
