                    This project was a response to rising food insecurity in the GTA at the height of the pandemic while leveraging the excess of food found in local supermarkets and neighborhoods.
                    My project partner and I were interested in the concept of food sharing, community-based projects that redistribute excess food as an open source to the public. Such projects already exist in cities such as 
                    Berlin or New York, and recently gaining a lot of traction in the city of Toronto with the emergence of Community Fridges TOronto (CFTO).<br><br>

                    Through our research informed through user journey maps, empathy maps and more importantly, interviews with participants of CFTO, my project partner and I proposed an digital platform/application, <i>Common</i> that would
                    help communicate the specific needs of individuals that participate in food sharing through community fridges. These users individuals, although not limited to, people that donate or take food, people that
                    transport excess food, storefronts or restaurantst that host fridges, or people that maintain fridges.<br><br>
            
                    The name of the application <i>Common</i> comes from the concept of <i>food as commons</i> in which food is not just a commodity for trade, but <i>a commons or public good that is potentially sacred and capable of bringing communities closer</i>.
                    We wanted the look and feel of the appplication to allude to the shelves of a fridge and have room for customization so the individuality and specificity of each fridge or community can be reflected. Additionally, we ideated on offline solutions
                    that provide access to the fridges while ensuring a level of accountibility to the food sharing community through the implementation of NFC key fob's.<br><br>
