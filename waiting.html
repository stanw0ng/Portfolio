        Transferring ideas of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-place#:~:text=Non%2Dplace%20or%20nonplace%20is,places%22%20in%20their%20anthropological%20definition."><u>non-place</u></a> and the photography of Lynne Cohen into digital interactions, the space of a waiting
        room is replicated onto the Internet, the ultimate non-place. Here, users must reckon with various
        objects while they wait to advance their position in a queue. The objects all have a unique set
        of interactions built in; some relate to one another while others are completely independent.
        Interactions are all somewhat incoherent in nature, offering moments of surprise for
        users, generating a micro-narrative in an otherwise mundane environment. Reinforcing the
        idea a non-space, a muzak cover of <i>Close to You</i> by the Carpenters loops in the background,
        offering respite from waiting for the first play-through's, but gradually transforms into the
        soundtrack of a horrible nightmare as it endlessly repeats.

      <p class="description">Interaction Branching</p>

      <p>
        By completing each interaction, users will move up in the queue. The order in which these actions
        occur does not matter, there is no linear path to reach the final event where users can
        finally leave the current room. However, despite advancing into the next space, the user will
        always find themselves similar room again, perpetually waiting and preoccupying themselves
        with interactions in hopes that something meaningful may happen.
